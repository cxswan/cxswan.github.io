Hi, I'm Cole X. Swain, a mathematics and computer science student at the University of Montevallo in Montevallo, Alabama. I am a senior and I am currently planning on pursuing a PhD in Mathematics. I'm passionate about mathematics however, I am also interested in photography, and exploring the outdoors. Currently, I'm working on two exciting research projects, with one paper titled "Enumerating Visible Tilings" published in the 34th volume of Geombinatorics Quarterly. One of the other research projects began at the 2024 Iowa State Math REU enumerating maximal independent sets in grid-like graphs. If you would like to know more take a look at the projects page.
                       
My academic journey is driven by my genuine curiosity about the world. I am actively involved in various campus activities. I served as the president of both the mathematics club and the astronomy club, where I led initiatives that brought our community together through mathematics and astronomy. I am also an active member of the Outdoor Adventure club, doing multiple hikes and cave exploration trips throughout the semester.
