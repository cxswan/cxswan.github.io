Hi, I'm Cole X. Swain, a mathematics and computer science student at the University of Montevallo in Montevallo, Alabama. I am a senior and I am currently planning on pursuing a PhD in Mathematics. I'm passionate about mathematics however, I am also interested in photography, and exploring the outdoors. Currently, I'm working on two exciting research projects, with one paper already submitted for publication. One of these research projects began at the 2024 Iowa State Math REU! If you would like to know more information about these projects look into my research page.
                       
My academic journey is driven by my genuine curiosity about the world. I am actively involved in various campus activities. I serve as the president of both the mathematics club and the astronomy club, where I lead initiatives that bring our community together with mathematics and space. I am also an active member of the Outdoor Adventure club, doing multiple hikes and cave exploration trips a month.
