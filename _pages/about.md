Hi, I’m Cole. I’m a first-year Mathematics PhD student at the University of Mississippi. I earned my undergraduate degree in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Montevallo.

I’m passionate about mathematics, but I also love photography and exploring the outdoors. Right now, I’m working on two exciting research projects. One of my papers, Enumerating Visible Tilings, was published in the 34th volume of Geombinatorics Quarterly. Another project began at the 2024 Iowa State Math REU, where I studied maximal independent sets in grid-like graphs.

You can learn more about my work on the Projects page.
